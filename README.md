## 🤝 Working as a Team

### Git  Branching Workflow

1. **Create a new feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Set the branch to track your remote:**
   ```bash
   git push --set-upstream origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Before making new changes, sync with `main` using rebase. Ensure your working directory is clean:**
   ```bash
   git status        # Check for uncommitted changes
   git pull --rebase origin main
   ```

4. **If `git status` shows changes (in red), stage them before continuing:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git add .
   git commit -m "syncing with main"
   ```

5. **Make your changes, then commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "your descriptive commit message"
   git push
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request (PR)** on GitHub to merge your feature branch into `main`.

> Once the PR is opened, we’ll schedule a quick walkthrough to review your changes.

### ✅ Best Practices

- Use meaningful branch names like `feature/price-alerts` or `fix/yoy-analysis`.
- Write clear and consistent commit messages.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Avoid making more commits after submitting a PR unless part of review feedback.
